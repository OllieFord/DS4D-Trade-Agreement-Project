Instruction

Nodes in the overview network diagram of Country&Organization file represent the countries and organizations that have signed agreements 
in the data. To make the observation more obvious, the size and color of nodes are sorted according to the same nodes attribute -- degree. 
In other words, nodes of the same color have the same size, and the size of nodes can be understood as the number of agreements signed 
within the time interval covered by the data. For example, in picture overview3, nodes representing India, China, US, Australia, Japan and 
Singapore have the same size and color, which means that these countries have the same activity in 450 pieces of international trade. 
At the same time, nodes are grouped together in different layouts, reflecting the degree of trade relationship between countries or 
organizations.

In the region network graph, nodes represent all regions that have appeared in the data. The principle of node size and color division is 
consistent with the overview series pictures, but the difference is that the thickness of connecting nodes can be used to indicate how many
agreements are signed between regions represented by two nodes. The thicker the connection, the more agreements are signed.

In the image set, the time segments contained in the data are divided into groups every 10 years, thus refining the network graph to more 
easily observe the changes in the international trade pattern in each decade. The principle of node size and color division is also same 
as description before.
