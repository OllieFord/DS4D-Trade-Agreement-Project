            <p> For this work we have been using <b>data visualization</b> as a means to gain insight into the underlying <b>structure and relationships</b> of international trade agreements. Our dataset is comprised of 450 preferential international trade agreements with the majority (424) being in english. The original dataset is open to the public and can be found here [link].</p> 
            
            <p> Using data mining and visualisation techniques is interesting in this context as legal documents use lots of boilerplate language as well as being very precise in their wording. There has been little previous work towards using computational analysis and visualisation in the domain of international trade, making this work especially exciting.</p>
            <p> For this work we have two main areas of inquiry.
                <ol>
                    <li>First, is it possible to uncover the relationships between countries by analysing the legal documents and, if so to what extent?</li> 
                    <li>Second, the relationships between the documents themselves, for example, do previous trade agreements impact later ones?</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

                <p>
                    For out first series of visualisations we investigate the similarity and possible relationships between trade agreement documents.  We do this using topic modeling in combination with clustering and techniques to visualise these clusters.

                <p>
                    Word embeddings is a technique for representing words based on the context in which they appear. It is capable of capturing a measure of similarity between words by associating those that appear frequently. 
In this case we are using an algorithm called WMD for measuring the distance (similarity) between trade agreements. The model we are using has been pretrained on wikipedia documents (glove-wiki-gigaword-300)
